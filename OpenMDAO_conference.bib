  abstract = {Optimal nacelle placement is critical to commercial or transport aircraft designs that use engines mounted with nacelles. Over-wing nacelle (OWN) configuration has a high potential to improve upon the conventional under-wing nacelle (UWN) configuration. OWN configurations have two critical benefits when compared to the conventional UWN configuration: 1. they ease the integration of high BPR and ultra-high BPR engines by alleviating ground clearance issues, and 2. they provide a significant amount of noise reduction because the wing blocks the noise of the fan and the jet. Despite their advantages, the OWN technology is not used in practical aircraft designs due to the difficulties in the aeropropulsive integration of the propulsion system. In this work, we propose using a coupled aeropropulsive design optimization framework to study the aeropropulsive integration for OWN configurations. The coupling behavior between the aerodynamics of the wing and the propulsion
system is extremely important. Especially in OWN configurations, the propulsion system is highly influenced by the aerodynamic performance of the wing. In this paper, we address the design problem of coupling between the aerodynamic and the propulsion system. We also explore wide range of design space to achieve the best practical design. The changes in wing shape are insignificant when the OWN configuration is optimized for different FPR. Wing in OWN performs better when the propulsor is close to the wing's root; however, the overall drag increases when the propulsor is close to the root. This increases the shaft power need. In addition, nacelle placement at the aft of the trailing edge shows better performance than forward of the trailing edge of the wing. These advancements in design optimization capabilities will be critical in the future design of OWN configurations to achieve more environmentally sustainable aircraft designs.},

  abstract = {Electric and hybrid-electric propulsion systems are key technologies for sustainable aviation. Electric propulsion systems introduce many design possibilities, which must be considered in the conceptual design stage to take full advantage of electrification. This makes for a challenging conceptual design problem. Architecture optimization can be applied to explore large design spaces and au tomatically find the best architectures for a set of requirements. Electric propulsion architecture optimization requires automated and flexible propulsion system modeling. It also requires the analysis of the propulsion architecture at an aircraft level to compute a meaningful objective function for the optimization. In this study, we present an approach for defining the propulsion system architectures and evaluating their aircraft-level performance. A propulsion architecture is defined using a modular interface, allowing architectures to be automatically evaluated on the
aircraft-level for a predefined mission. OpenConcept, an open source conceptual design and optimization toolkit, is used to implement the multidisciplinary problem. We present a case study of the electrification of a regional transport aircraft Beechcraft King Air C90GT with automated definition, integration and evaluation of five different propulsion systems. We perform multidisciplinary design optimization to minimize fuel burn and maximum takeoff weight for a sweep of design ranges and battery specific energies. Our approach opens the door to electric propulsion architecture optimization.},

  abstract = {The conceptual design process of aircraft starts by deciding the representative mission requirements, followed by optimization of design variables to satisfy the given requirements. However, selecting appropriate mission requirements is not an obvious task, particularly when designing the package delivery UAVs because UAVs must accommodate the various combinations of package weight and delivery distances. The complexity increases further when designing a heterogeneous fleet of UAVs that serves a large number of customers. In this work, we tackle this problem by solving the coupled design-operation optimization to find the optimal mission requirements and the optimal UAV designs simultaneously. We formulate this problem as mixed-integer nonlinear optimization and propose a sequential heuristic algorithm to solve the coupled problem. The benchmark study of the proposed algorithm against a non-convex branch-and-cut solver shows that the sequential heuristics are
effective. We also demonstrate that the simultaneous UAV design and routing optimization reduces the fleet acquisition cost by more than 10\% on average compared to the conventional baseline.},

To capture this trade-off, we propose simultaneous optimization of aircraft conceptual design and takeoff trajectory. Design- trajectory optimization, also called open-loop control co-design, allows us to find the optimal aircraft design that balances the flight efficiency between various flight conditions for maximum system-level performance. In this paper, we maximize the payload weight capacity of a lift-plus-cruise unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for package delivery. As a result, simultaneous optimization increases the payload weight by up to 5.3\% compared to the conventional approach, which does not couple takeoff trajectory optimization to UAV conceptual design. We identify that the cruise speed and pusher motor sizing have a significant influence on takeoff trajectory. Simultaneous
optimization finds the optimal cruise speed and motor sizing that enables energy-efficient wing-borne climb, which is not always possible with conventional sequential optimization.},

Despite their benefits, OWN technology is not widely used in real aircraft designs because of the challenges and lack of research in aeropropulsive integration of the propulsion system. In this work, we present multipoint aeropropulsive design optimizations of an OWN configuration to address several scenarios. To effectively design the propulsor in OWN, we consider on-design and off-design formulations of engine design concepts. In this work, we present one single-point optimization and three multipoint optimizations. In the multipoint optimizations, the objective is to minimize the shaft power at cruise conditions subject to
constraints. To compare the performance degradation of single-point optimization, we performed several sub-optimizations to reflect the multipoint cases. The single-point optimal design required additional 0.4\% shaft power across the cruise conditions when compared to the multipoint optimization with 3 cruise points. In addition, distortion-constrained and distortion-unconstrained optimizations were performed at the take-off scenario. By modifying the inlet shape of the nacelle, the distortion-constrained optimization effectively reduces the distortion in the take-off scenario at the outermost radial ring over the fan by penalizing the cruise performance. The multipoint optimizations in this work highlight a number of significant design effects. An effective design is produced by including the required flight conditions and specifying the proper objective and constraints in the OWN multipoint problem. These design optimization capabilities will be crucial in
determining the viability of novel propulsion concepts for next-generation OWN aircraft.},

  abstract = {Hydrogen aircraft have the potential to achieve greater climate impact reductions at a lower cost than aircraft powered by biofuels or other drop-in sustainable aviation fuels. But even as a liquid, hydrogen requires four times more volume than kerosene to store the same energy. Companies and researchers have suggested that the blended wing body configuration is well-suited to hydrogen because it can efficiently store the large fuel tanks. However, nobody has quantified this claim, at least publicly. We address this gap by comparing optimized kerosene and hydrogen versions of blended wing body and tube and wing aircraft. We find that the blended wing body configuration has only a small advantage for onboard hydrogen storage compared to a conventional tube and wing aircraft. Our models predict that with ambitious hydrogen tank technology assumptions, a hydrogen blended wing body uses 3.1\% more energy than a kerosene blended wing body, while the energy increase for a
tube and wing is 5.1\%. An advantage of the blended wing body is that the energy consumption increase when adapting from kerosene to hydrogen fuel appears to be far less sensitive than the tube and wing's to empty weight and drag changes. Because we only compare hydrogen and kerosene usage within the same configuration, a hydrogen blended wing body may still consume substantially less energy than a hydrogen tube and wing. However, these results do call into question the assumed tank storage benefit of a hydrogen-powered blended wing body aircraft.},

Thus, the modularization of various disciplines is necessary to efficiently couple them in MDO or multidisciplinary design analysis (MDA).

In the MDO problem, the software architecture enables the optimal integration of high-fidelity workflows with central data management for high performance computing (HPC). To this end, we demonstrate how the FlowSimulator Data Manager (FSDM) enables the associated HPC simulation components to exchange massively parallel data in memory. Here, the algorithms provided by OpenMDAO---linear and nonlinear solution methods, and forward and backward
processing of sensitivity derivatives---operate on the infrastructure of the FlowSimulator HPC ecosystem. Based on the defined scenario, different solution strategies can be applied. In this work we define a nested aeroelastic coupling setup within a trim equilibrium constraint definition. In particular, we highlight how an efficient modularization of the individual disciplines supports an effective gradient assembly and thus makes them available to the individual solution hierarchies and strategies. With this approach, we show how it is possible to transform a baseline constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained optimization definition, while still ensuring the trim equilibrium through an implicit solution based on the Schur complement method.},

  abstract = {Aerodynamic shape optimization is a valuable tool for aircraft design, but geometric constraints have had limited design freedom or have failed to capture spatial integration requirements in sufficient detail. Using a detailed representation of an aircraft's systems and payload geometries in a packaging constraint allows for more accurate and higher-performance spatial integration. We use a previously developed general and differentible packaging constraint formulated for gradient-based optimization for aerodynamic shape optimization of a full aircraft configuration. We explore the design of the NASA tiltwing concept vehicle with aerodynamic shape optimization using packaging constraints to examine the tradeoffs between aerodynamics and mission performance. The resulting design can be more targeted to our design requirements than one that can be achieved with conventional geometric constraints.},

  abstract = {To improve performance and reduce fuel consumption, we must address tightly connected aeropropulsive effects in the development of new and existing propulsion technologies. Aeropropulsive design optimization considers the multidisciplinary coupled interactions between aerodynamics, thermodynamics, and geometry. Mixed-fidelity aeropropulsive methods integrate high-fidelity aerodynamic solvers with zero-dimensional thermodynamic cycle modeling. Combined with gradient-based optimization, this approach is a computationally efficient design tool that can accommodate large design spaces with many design variables and constraints. Previously, we developed a novel hybrid aeropropulsive coupling method for turbofan engines and demonstrated its feasibility using a single-design-point problem. In this work, we improve upon the prior approach and perform the first successful coupled aeropropulsive optimization of a high-bypass turbofan. We analyze the optimized turbofan design
and validate the corrections to the hybrid coupling scheme. The updated coupling methods are a significant advancement in aeropropulsive optimization that enable the design of tightly integrated propulsion systems considering thermodynamic and aerodynamic performance.},

  abstract = {Three-surface configurations offer theoretical drag benefits over two-surface configurations, but the literature is unclear on what is the best configuration for a supersonic aircraft. This work uses trim-constrained drag minimization to compare the trim drag for three-surface, canard, and conventional variants of a supersonic transport aircraft. We first use RANS-based optimization to determine the minimum trim drag for a fixed planform geometry at a subsonic takeoff condition and a supersonic cruise condition. The three-surface configuration has the lowest trim drag at the supersonic condition. The canard and three-surface configurations have comparable trim drag at the subsonic condition. We then construct a supersonic buildup model to study the effects of variable trim surface sizing. When the trim surface spans are included as design variables, the design for minimum supersonic drag has practically no tail and a canard sized at 36% of the wing half-span. These
results suggest that a canard configuration is best for supersonic trim drag.},
